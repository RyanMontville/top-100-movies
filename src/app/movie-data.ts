        title: "Reservoir Dogs",
        empireDescription: "Making his uber cool and supremely confident directorial debut, Quentin Tarantino hit audiences with a terrific twist on the heist-gone-wrong thriller. For the most part a single location chamber piece, Reservoir Dogs delights in ricocheting the zing and fizz of its dialogue around its gloriously  -and indeed gore-iously)  - intense setting, with the majority of the movie's action centring around one long and incredibly bloody death scene. Packing killer lines, killer needledrops, and killer, er, killers too, not only is this a rollicking ride in its own right, but it also set the blueprint for everything we've come to expect from a Tarantino joint. Oh, and by the way: Nice Guy Eddie was shot by Mr. White. Who fired twice. Case closed.",
        movieOverview: "A botched robbery indicates a police informant, and the pressure mounts in the aftermath at a warehouse. Crime begets violence as the survivors -- veteran Mr. White, newcomer Mr. Orange, psychopathic parolee Mr. Blonde, bickering weasel Mr. Pink and Nice Guy Eddie -- unravel.",

Andie McDowell brings the brains and the heart as distant-but-ever-closer-coming producer Rita Hanson. And Harold Ramis, directing and co-writing with Danny Rubin, manages to spin gold from the well-worn thread of a man stuck in time. Whilst this time-loop dramedy might not have been the first film to drink from this particular trope's well, it is inarguably head and shoulders above the rest. Murray's customarily snarky delivery gets the easy laughs flowing early doors, but it's the way the movie finds deeper things to say about existence and morals as it goes on, all whilst never feeling overly preachy or worthy, that keeps us coming back to it again, and again, and again.",

Yet co-writer/director Paul King delivered a truly wonderful film bursting with joy, imagination, kindness, and just the odd hard stare from our beloved Peruvian bear. How was he going to follow that? By making one of the greatest sequels  - nay, one of the best movies period  - of all time, naturally. Matching wits with Hugh Grant's moustache-twirlingly evil and deliciously outr\u00e9 washed-up actor Phoenix Buchanan, Paddington (Ben Whishaw) is on typically adorable form here as his search for a special present for his Great Aunt Lucy leads to all sorts of hilarious hijinks . Like all great sequels, this one takes everything that made the first so good and builds on it, dialing up the spectacle, the silliness, and the emotional stakes. The result is as sweet as marmalade.",

Sure, a cynic could read the film as the story of Audrey Tatou's monomaniacal title character's relentless, somewhat stalkerish pursuit of the hapless Nino (Matthieu Kassovitz) around Montmartre's dream-like cityscape. But this one isn't for the cynics  - it's a tribute to the daydreamers of this world.

Played out against the beautiful mountain landscapes of Wyoming (or, in reality, the Canadian Rockies), the decades-spanning love story between shepherds Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal)  - two men who unexpectedly find love on the titular mountainside, only to find it tested over the years as societal mores and heteronormative expectations work against them  - is sensually observed and immaculately shot. Not only does it give you hope and breaks your heart in equal measure, but the multiple Oscar-winning movie's impact on queer cinema continues to be felt today. Even now, almost two decades later, we still don't know how to quit it (and honestly, we don't want to).",

        empireDescription: "A high school drama with a time traveling, tangential universe threading, sinister rabbit featuring twist, Richard Kelly's deliberately labyrinthine opus was always destined for cult classic status. A certifiable flop upon its theatrical release, Kelly's film was one of the early beneficiaries of physical media's move to DVD, with the movie gaining a fandom in film obsessives who could pause, play, and skip back and forth through it at will. Any attempt to synopsise the movie is a fool's errand, but there's more than a hint of It's A Wonderful Life in the way we see Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal, in a star-making turn) experiencing how the world would be worse off if he survives the jet engine that mysteriously crashes through his bedroom. That the film, with all its heavy themes and brooding atmosphere, manages to eventually land on a note of overwhelming optimism is a testament to Kelly's mercurial moviemaking. A mad world (mad world) Donnie Darko's may be, but it's also one that continues to beguile and fascinate as new fans find themselves obsessed with uncovering its mysteries.",

Michael Cera is on peak socially awkward Cera form here as the eponymous put-upon protagonist who's forced to face his new girlfriend's (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) seven evil exes in a series of increasingly wild face-offs.

In all seriousness though, Besson's film  - which sees Reno's titular contract killer caught up in an unlikely coming-of-age tale after his next-door neighbours wind up on the wrong side of a DEA sting  - is very much its own beast. Inarguably, its greatest strength however isn't Reno, or even Gary Oldman's unhinged baddie Stansfield, but a very young Natalie Portman, who delivers a luminous, career-creating performance as vengeful 12-year-old Mathilda. Despite some of the ickiness inherent in the relationship the film presents between a middle-aged man and a pre-teen girl, Portman's phenomenal performance helps augment an unlikely kinship that winds up being deeply affecting to watch.",

Instead, he made The Terminator  - and the rest, as they say, is history. Shot on a $6 million budget, Cameron's sophomore feature may crib a little from Michael Crichton's Westworld and Harlan Ellison's Outer Limits episode 'Soldier', but its action  - which revolves around Arnold Schwarzenegger's instantly iconic shot-gun toting, shades rocking, time travelling cyborg killer  - is, outside of Cameron's own oeuvre since, without comparison. Made with all the relentless tension of a slasher (after all, what is Arnie's Terminator if not Michael Myers in leathers?) and the kinetic thrills of a balls-to-the-wall blockbuster, nothing has been the same since the T-800 told Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor \"Come with me if you want to live.\"",

But this is no mere jump-scare chiller, not by a long stretch. In fact, the real reason it continues to affect audience so deeply today is because of the way Friedkin, through the figures of Fathers Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow), so skilfully stages a soul-shaking crisis of faith, sustaining and building an atmosphere of such dread, such spiritual torment, that you can't help but feel you've unleashed something Satanic simply by watching it.",

Using powers reserved to Wakandan kings, T'Challa assumes the Black Panther mantle to join with ex-girlfriend Nakia, the queen-mother, his princess-kid sister, members of the Dora Milaje (the Wakandan 'special forces') and an American secret agent, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war.",

        empireDescription: "Before its release, you might have been forgiven for thinking that Edgar Wright's proper feature directorial debut would be Spaced: The Movie. Which, honestly, probably would've been great actually. But what we got was so, so much more. A zom-rom-com made with real genre nous and a distinctly British sense of humour, Wright's movie strikes the perfect balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and seriously gruesome undead horror. From its perfectly synchronised 'Don't Stop Me Now' zombie beatdown, to Nick Frost and Simon Pegg's star-making, side-splitting performances, to Edgar Wright's go-for-broke gonzo approach to shooting and editing, this is British filmmaking at its finest. Fuck-a-doodle-doo!",
        movieOverview: "Shaun lives a supremely uneventful life, which revolves around his girlfriend, his mother, and, above all, his local pub. This gentle routine is threatened when the dead return to life and make strenuous attempts to snack on ordinary Londoners.",

As listless college grad Charlotte and world weary actor Bob, Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray share an ineffable chemistry, both offering beautifully understated performances as two people whose geographic and emotional sense of dislocation in Tokyo is simultaneously what brings them together and, ultimately, what keeps them apart, too. And its ending, in which Bill Murray's Bob whispers words we never hear into Charlotte's ear, is an all-timer. For an anti-romance, it sure does feel incredibly romantic all the same.",

Among the best to grasp such an opportunity is Kiwi auteur Taika Waititi, the man who helped Chris Hemsworth's Thor find the only weapon in his arsenal more mighty than Mjolnir  - his funny bone! After the more Shakespearean severity of his first two solo movies, Thor Ragnarok shakes up the God of Thunder's entire world by, well, pretty much destroying it. And do you know what? It has an absolute blast doing it. Full of action, bursting with colour, and boasting a uniformly excellent ensemble  - Mark Ruffalo! Tessa Thompson! Jeff Goldblum! Cate Blanchett!  - this is pretty much the Platonic ideal of a popcorn superhero blockbuster. And we're pretty sure The Godfather hasn't got a Korg, either. Anybody want a pamphlet?",

In fact, it was even marketed as such. But a Tarantino picture The Usual Suspects ain't. Taking the line-up team-up concept as a starting point for something altogether different in execution, Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie's super-twisted, uber-cool crime thriller attains true greatness through its inventive use of a supernatural-horror style backdrop. In the shape of mythic crime lord Keyser Soze, the movie fashions a phantom menace terrifying enough to put the willies up even the most hardened of criminals. Turns out the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was actually convincing us all this was going to be just another crime movie.",

Virtually no marketing beyond some shots of the Bates Motel and some old house overlooking it. And then, for the entire opening act, you think you've got it all figured out  - it's a good old-fashioned noir! Janet Leigh's on the lam with a bunch of her boss' money and heading for a new life. And then she stops at that motel from the promos, meets the strange-but-nice-enough Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and hops in the shower. Then suddenly STAB! goes a knife. STAB! goes Bernard Hermann's piercing string score. And again, and again, and again. And from that moment on, you're rooted to your seat, in thrall to a madman (whether that's Hitch or Norman is your call), and certain to never be the same again. Pure cinema!

Quartet of epic crime novels hardly screams prime fodder for the big-screen treatment. The miracle of Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's L. A. Confidential then, which adapts the third book in Ellroy's quartet, is that not only does it viscerally capture the author's noirish sense of Los Angeles as a dark-hearted labyrinth, a City of Angels whose angels are falling, but it also manages to trim all the fat off the original 500-ish page tome without losing any of its soul or meaning.

It only takes a look at the success of the Duffer brothers' Stranger Things to see the Amblin approach will never go out of style. Never has that moviemaking method been more perfectly encapsulated however than in Steven Spielberg's actual Amblin joint E.T. The Extraterrestrial. Equal parts stonking children's adventure and poignant meditation on familial dysfunction and our capacity for healing, E.T. carefully beds its supernatural elements in an utterly relatable everykid world, tempering its cuter, more sentimental moments with a true sense of jeopardy. Boasting an extraordinary lead performance from a 10-year-old Henry Thomas, one of John Williams greatest scores, and an ending that still has us in floods over forty years later, E.T. remains the gold standard for family filmmaking.",

Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman all added something as directors (with Rothman co-writing alongside Lord) and their animators whipped up a visually dynamic, exciting, and heartwarming adventure that literally spans multiverses before the MCU introduced it. Bringing Miles Morales to the screen was a masterstroke, and Shameik Moore's vocal work gives him buckets of charm.",
        movieOverview: "Struggling to find his place in the world while juggling school and family, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales is unexpectedly bitten by a radioactive spider and develops unfathomable powers just like the one and only Spider-Man. While wrestling with the implications of his new abilities, Miles discovers a super collider created by the madman Wilson \"Kingpin\" Fisk, causing others from across the Spider-Verse to be inadvertently transported to his dimension.",

Which is a brilliantly weird, round-the-houses way of reminding us that heartbreak should be valued as one of the things that makes us. Better to have loved and lost, and all that.",

        title: "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back",
        empireDescription: "The original \"this one's darker\" sequel, and by far the strongest of the saga. Not just because the baddies win (temporarily), or because it Force-slammed us with that twist (\"No, I am your father\"). Empire super-stardestroys thanks to the way it deepens the core relationships  - none more effectively than Han and Leia's. She loves him. He knows. And it still hurts.",
        movieOverview: "The epic saga continues as Luke Skywalker, in hopes of defeating the evil Galactic Empire, learns the ways of the Jedi from aging master Yoda. But Darth Vader is more determined than ever to capture Luke. Meanwhile, rebel leader Princess Leia, cocky Han Solo, Chewbacca, and droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are thrown into various stages of capture, betrayal and despair.",

        title: "The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring",
        empireDescription: "A wizard is never late. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he... well, you know the rest. It might have taken 20 years for Peter Jackson's plucky fantasy to clamber, Mount-Doom-style, to the very pinnacle of our greatest-movies pantheon. But here it is, brighter and more resplendent than ever.The Fellowship Of The Ring contains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you've experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a regular film could possibly muster up. But Jackson is only getting started. Onwards his adventure hustles, to the bravura dungeoneering of Khazad-dum, to the sinisterly serene glades of Lothlorien, to the final requiem for flawed Boromir amidst autumnal leaves. As Fellowship thrums to its conclusion, finally applying the brakes with a last swell of Howard Shore's heavenly score, you're left feeling euphoric, bereft and hopeful, all at the same time. The Two Towers has the coolest battle. The Return Of The King boasts the most batshit, operatic spectacle. But Fellowship remains the most perfect of the three, matching every genius action beat with a soul-stirring emotional one, as its Middle-earth-traversing gang swells in size in the first act, then dwindles in the third. This oddball suicide squad has so much warmth and wit, they're not just believable as friends of each other  - they've come to feel like they're our pals too.An ornately detailed masterwork with a huge, pulsing heart, it's just the right film for our times  - full of craft, conviction and a belief that trudging forward, step by step, in dark days is the bravest act of all. Its ultimate heroes aren't the strongest, or those with the best one-liners, but the ones who just keep going. And so Fellowship endures: a miracle of storytelling, a feat of filmmaking and still the gold standard for cinematic experiences. Right, now that's decided, who's up for second breakfast?",
        movieOverview: "Young hobbit Frodo Baggins, after inheriting a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo, must leave his home in order to keep it from falling into the hands of its evil creator. Along the way, a fellowship is formed to protect the ringbearer and make sure that the ring arrives at its final destination: Mt. Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed.",
